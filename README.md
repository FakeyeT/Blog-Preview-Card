## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I gained a better understanding of creating responsive layouts using **Flexbox**. Additionally, I refined my use of CSS custom properties to manage colors and typography more effectively.

```css
.category {
    display: flex;
    padding: 0.4rem 1.2rem;
    color: var(--gray-950);
    background-color: var(--yellow);
    font-weight: 800;
    align-self: flex-start;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving the following:

1. **Accessibility (A11y):** To make sure all interactive elements are easily accessible via keyboard and/or screen readers.
2. **CSS Performance:** Using tools like CSS audit plugins to reduce unused styles and optimize my code further.

### Useful resources

-   [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was instrumental in helping me structure the layout for this challenge.
-   [MDN Web Docs - CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) - Helped me understand how to use and manage CSS variables effectively.
